PR Guidelines

1. Aim to create small, focused pull requests that fulfill a single purpose.
Smaller pull requests are easier and faster to review and merge, leave less room to introduce bugs, and
provide a clearer history of changes.

2. Review, build, and test your own pull request before submitting it.
This will allow you to catch errors or typos that you may have missed, before others start reviewing.

3. Write clear titles and descriptions for your pull requests so that reviewers can quickly understand what
the pull request does.

--> If your pull request consists of changes to multiple files, provide guidance to reviewers about the
order in which to review the files. Recommend where to start and how to proceed with the review.
